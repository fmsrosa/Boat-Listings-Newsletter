# Boat-Listings-Newsletter
Data Analyst Certification (Datacamp)

This repository contains my solution of the required case study for the Data Analyst Certification by Datacamp. 
The case study refers to a new newsletter to help sellers get more views on their boat listings. It uses the number of views of the boat listings along with its characteristics in order to select which features popular listings have in common.

I was given 24h to prepare a 8 slides presentation, which I then during a 10-minute video call. 
The repository contains the notebook I used to clean and analyze the data, and my presentation.
